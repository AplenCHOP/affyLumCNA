First, extract allele-specific signal values from Illumina files using GenomeStudio.

Go to Menu Analysis: Select Reports -> Report Wizard ->  Final Report
Within the Standard Format Options Dialog make sure Standard is selected. 
Drag the following variables to the left side, labeled as Displayed Fields:

SNP Name
Chr
Position
B Allele Freq
Log R Ratio

In the General Options tab make sure the data will be exported in a tab-seperated fashion with 1 sample stored per file (1 Samples / File). Finish with the export. Group by sample should be selected. Make sure to export the samples table as well because sample identifiers will be lost in the exporting process.
